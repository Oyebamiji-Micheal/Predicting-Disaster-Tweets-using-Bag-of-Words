## About the Project

<p align="justify">
This project is focused on predicting whether a given tweet is related to a real disaster or not. The objective is to utilize NLP techniques to process and analyze the textual content of tweets and create a predictive model that can accurately classify tweets as disaster-related or not. The dataset was gotten from a Kaggle competition, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/">NLP Getting Started - Disaster Tweet Prediction</a>.

My main goal is to familiarize myself with fundamental NLP concepts, including tokenization, lemmatization, stop words, stemming, and the bag of words model. In addition, I aim to gain hands-on experience in applying NLP techniques to real-world text data and understanding their impact on model performance.
